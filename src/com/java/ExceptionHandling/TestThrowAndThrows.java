	 * Sr. no. Basis of Differences throw throws 
	 * 1. Definition 
	 * Java throw keyword is
	 * used throw an exception explicitly in the code, inside the function or the
	 * block of code. 
	 * Java throws keyword is used in the method signature to declare
	 * an exception which might be thrown by the function while the execution of the
	 * code. 
	 * 2. Type of exception Using throw keyword, we can only propagate
	 * unchecked exception i.e., the checked exception cannot be propagated using
	 * throw only. 
	 * Using throws keyword, we can declare both checked and unchecked
	 * exceptions. However, the throws keyword can be used to propagate checked
	 * exceptions only.
	 *  3. Syntax The throw keyword is followed by an instance of
	 * Exception to be thrown. 
	 * The throws keyword is followed by class names of
	 * Exceptions to be thrown. 
	 * 4. Declaration throw is used within the method.
	 * throws is used with the method signature.
	 *  5. Internal implementation We are
	 * allowed to throw only one exception at a time i.e. we cannot throw multiple
	 * exceptions. 
	 * We can declare multiple exceptions using throws keyword that can
	 * be thrown by the method. For example, main() throws IOException,
	 * SQLException.
